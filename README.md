I would like to thank the following resources that have made this project possible:

- **[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)**: WordPress provided a versatile and robust platform for building our website. Its flexible content management system (CMS) and extensive plugin ecosystem allowed us to efficiently develop and manage a wide range of HR services. The customizable themes and intuitive interface greatly enhanced our workflow and the overall user experience of the application.

I am grateful for these tools and the developers behind them for their contributions to the open-source community. Their support and continuous development have significantly enhanced our project's success.
